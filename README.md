The PyTorch implementation of StyleGAN2 is from https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch

The pre-trained model is from https://github.com/pbaylies/stylegan2

Model details and custom CUDA kernel codes are from official repostiories: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2

Codes for Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity, LPIPS came from https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity

To match FID scores more closely to tensorflow official implementations, I have used FID Inception V3 implementations in https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid
